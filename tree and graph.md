1. If two trees have the same preorder, inorder, or postorder iterations, those two trees can still be different
2. All types of DFS can be implemented iteratively, but postorder and inorder are more complicated to implement than preorder (which is very easy) (need to go through the iterative approaches for inorder and postorder prior to interviews)
